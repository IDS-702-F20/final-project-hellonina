Lifestyle factor correlation. A wide variety of lifestyle factors are also of great importance to the development of T2DM, such as sedentary lifestyle 38, physical inactivity 39, smoking 40 and alcohol consumption 41. Substantial epidemiological studies have shown that obesity is the most important risk factor for T2DM, which may influence the development of insulin resistance and disease progression 42. Nearly 90% of diabetic patients develop T2DM mostly relating to excess body weight according to the World Health Organization (WHO, 2011). Furthermore, obesity is strongly inherited 43. Pamidi et al. demonstrated that obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a treatable sleep disorder that is pervasive among overweight and obese adults, has become a novel, modifiable risk factor relevant to insulin resistance and glucose intolerance, and may influence on the development of prediabetes (20%-67%) and T2DM (15%-30%), independent of shared risk factors 44-46. Several studies have indicated that OSA in T2DM patients is much more prevalent (36%-60%) than in the general population 47, 48.

In addition, diet is considered as a modifiable risk factor for T2DM. Studies have shown that a low-fiber diet with a high glycemic index is positively associated with a higher risk of T2DM 49, and specific dietary fatty acids may affect insulin resistance and the risk of diabetes in varying degrees 50. Total and saturated fat intake is associated with an increased risk of T2DM independently of BMI, but higher intake of linoleic acid has the opposite effect, especially among leaner and younger men 51. Frequent consumption of processed meat, but not other meats, may increase the risk of T2DM after adjustment for BMI, prior weight change, and alcohol and energy intake 51. Soft drinks have also been bounded up with increased risk of T2DM 52 and metabolic syndrome 53, because they are directly associated with BMI 54.

Type 2 DM is due primarily to lifestyle factors and genetics.15 A number of lifestyle factors are known to be important to the development of type 2 DM. These are physical inactivity, sedentary lifestyle, cigarette smoking and generous consumption of alcohol.16 Obesity has been found to contribute to approximately 55% of cases of type 2 DM.17 The increased rate of childhood obesity between the 1960s and 2000s is believed to have led to the increase in type 2 DM in children and adolescents.18 Environmental toxins may contribute to the recent increases in the rate of type 2 DM. A weak positive correlation has been found between the concentration in the urine of bisphenol A, a constituent of some plastics, and the incidence of type 2 DM.19

There is a strong inheritable genetic connection in type 2 DM, having relatives (especially first degree) with type 2 DM increases the risks of developing type 2 DM substantially. Concordance among monozygotic twins is close to 100%, and about 25% of those with the disease have a family history of DM.20 Recently, genes discovered to be significantly associated with developing type 2 DM, include TCF7L2, PPARG, FTO, KCNJ11, NOTCH2, WFS1, CDKAL1, IGF2BP2, SLC30A8, JAZF1, and HHEX. KCNJ11 (potassium inwardly rectifying channel, subfamily J, member 11), encodes the islet ATP-sensitive potassium channel Kir6.2, and TCF7L2 (transcription factor 7-like 2) regulates proglucagon gene expression and thus the production of glucagon-like peptide-1.21 Moreover, obesity (which is an independent risk factor for type 2 DM) is strongly inherited.22 Monogenic forms like Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), constitutes up to 5% of cases.23 There are many medical conditions which can potentially give rise to, or exacerbate type 2 DM. These include obesity, hypertension, elevated cholesterol (combined hyperlipidemia), and with the condition often termed metabolic syndrome (it is also known as Syndrome X, Reaven's syndrome).24 Other causes include acromegaly, Cushing's syndrome, thyrotoxicosis, pheochromocytoma, chronic pancreatitis, cancer, and drugs.25 Additional factors found to increase the risk of type 2 DM include aging,26 high-fat diets, and a less active lifestyle.
